# DeepDA

The DeepDA model, which is a GAN model for oceanic DA, comprises a generator that implements partial convolution as well as a discriminator.

# Process of DeepDA

  1. Training with CESM2 Large Ensemble data set (csh/train.run.csh)
  2. Generate reanalysis (csh/evaluate.run.csh)

# Data set (data format: netCDF4)

  - You can download data set here: in preparation..
  
  - The data set consists of the following:
  
    (1) Training set (CESM2 LE):
        Input: []
        Label: []
        
    (2) Validation set (CESM2 LE):
        Input: []
        Label: []
        
    (3) Test set (HadIOD):
        Input: []
